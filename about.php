        <h2>Hello, my name is Tim, and I am a 17-year-old studying software development at ICT Campus school.</h2><br>
        <h3>My current focus is on learning various programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, and
            JavaScript. I am passionate about software development and excited about the possibilities it
            offers.<br><br>
            When I'm not studying, I enjoy playing games and sailing during the summer months. In the winter, I enjoy
            repairing and painting boats, which is a fun and creative activity. Additionally, I have been a member of
            the scouting group Het ZuiderKruis for seven years, which has allowed me to develop important teamwork and
            leadership skills.</h3><br>
        <h2>Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio.</h2><br>
